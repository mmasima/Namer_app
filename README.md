# Namer_App

Hey there! This is my Namer_App, a Flutter application that helps you generate random names by combining two words together. I built this app as part of a codelab video, and I learned a lot about using some of the basic widgets in Flutter along the way.

## Features

- Generate random names by combining two words together.
- Add names to a list of favorites.
- Delete names from the list of favorites.

## What I learned

During the development of this app, I learned how to use several key widgets in Flutter. Here are some of the things I learned:

- The `Text` widget: This widget is used to display text on the screen. I used it to display the random name combinations that are generated by the app.
- The `FlatButton` widget: This widget is used to create a button that responds to user input. I used it to create the "Generate" button that generates random name combinations.
- The `ListView` widget: This widget is used to create a scrollable list of items. I used it to display the list of favorite names that the user can add to and delete from.
- The `StatefulWidget` and `State` classes: These classes are used to create widgets that can change their appearance or behavior over time. I used them to implement the "Add to favorites" and "Delete" functionality.

## Installation

To install and run this app, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. You can download it from the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Namer_App.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Namer_App
   ```

4. Run the app using the following command:

   ```
   flutter run
   ```

   This will launch the app on an emulator or a physical device, depending on your configuration.

## Conclusion

Building this simple app was a lot of fun, and it was great to relearn the basics of Flutter development. I'm excited to continue exploring the framework and building more complex applications in the future. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to let me know. Happy coding!
